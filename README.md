AI-Assisted Analysis Using Teachable Machine
PART A – THEORY
1.Two Components of Analyst OS & Their Role
Answer:
1.	Problem Framing Component
This component helps the analyst clearly define the real-world problem, stakeholders, and expected outcomes. It ensures the solution is aligned with business needs and user requirements.
2.	Insight & Decision Support Component
This component focuses on analyzing collected data, identifying patterns using AI tools, and generating actionable insights. It helps stakeholders make informed decisions based on data-driven evidence.
2. Define Elicitation & Two Techniques
Answer:
Elicitation is the process of gathering requirements, information, and insights from stakeholders to understand real-world problems clearly.
Two Techniques:
1.	Interviews – Direct conversation with stakeholders to understand their needs and pain points.
2.	Observation – Studying real-world behavior and processes to identify hidden problems.
3.Responsible AI Controls
Answer:
Two responsible AI controls are:
1.	Bias Monitoring – Ensuring the AI model does not produce unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
2.	Transparency & Explainability – Making sure the AI system’s decisions can be understood and explained to users.


PART B – TECHNICAL
Problem Identified:
Object classification using image-based machine learning.
Objective:
To build a simple AI model that can classify different objects using image recognition.
Model Description:
An Image Classification model was created using Google Teachable Machine.
Three classes were used:
1.	Mobile
2.	Book
3.	Bottle
Approximately 25 images were collected for each class using webcam from different angles and lighting conditions.
The model was trained using a pre-trained convolutional neural network.
After training, the model successfully classified real-time objects with good accuracy during preview testing.
Responsible AI Consideration:
The model was trained using balanced data across all classes to reduce bias and improve fairness.
